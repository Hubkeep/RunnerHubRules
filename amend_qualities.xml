	  <notes>This quality applies both its benefit and drawback to melee attacks.
Special Modifications

Elemental weaponry cannot be changed to Acid, Radiation, or Pollution damage types. Weapons which do not intrinsically possess an elemtental damage type cannot have one applied as an effect of this quality.

The Damage, AP, Concealability, and Reach stats on any weapon may be modified. Reach only affects Melee attacks, such as strikes with the butt of a rifle, when applied to Ranged weapons. Modifying Concealability or Reach does not alter the actual size of a weapon.

Recoil Compensation may only be applied to Ranged weapons.

Ammo capacity may only be modified on Ranged weapons, or on Melee weapons with a battery capacity.

They may use any weapon, including unarmed attacks, with the advantage that it halves the penalty for any called shot. When combined with other ways to reduce the called shot penalty, apply this quality’s effects after the other reductions are applied.

    Characters who have this quality as a consequence of a metagenetic quality or from being a metavariant do not suffer the penalty when hiding their style, and suffer only the RAW ramifications of this quality.
    GMs are encouraged to have NPCs make Memory tests when appropriate and remember that a character with this quality is distinctive, IE memorable, in some way.
